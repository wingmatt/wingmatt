### Howdy 👋 My name's Matt!

Depending on the day, I'm a professional tinkerer, active listener, and/or project manager.

I've built web apps, virtualized domain controllers, and counseled memory care patients.

I love when getting my stuff done includes static typing, solar power, or learning something new.

- 🔭 My last project was [Blatherbrush](https://wingmatt.dev/projects/blatherbrush/), a multiplayer AI image generation web app. What's next? Something involving Laravel!
- 🌱 I’m going through [Josh W. Comeau's Joy of React course](https://www.joyofreact.com/) right now to better understand what's going on with React under the hood.
- 💬 Ask me about TypeScript, React, or cooking 👨‍🍳
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I forgot how to ride a bike. They said it couldn't be done!
